Hola, I’m Jocelyn Navarro.



I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Arizona in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, advised by Professor Brian Enquist. I have 10+ years of experience conducting fieldwork to improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on plants. My dissertation research measures the effect of climate change on plant-water relations. I prioritize safety in the field and ensure all crew members have all they need for a successful day in the field. Field experiences are as follows: South Africa, Peru, Norway, Colorado, Connecticut, California and Arizona.
